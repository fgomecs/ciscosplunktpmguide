# 🚀 TPM Crash Course – Cisco/Splunk Interview Prep (Francisco Gomez)

## 🔁 1. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- **Phases**: Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
- **Models**: Waterfall (sequential), Agile (iterative), DevOps (continuous)
- **TPM Role**: Coordinate milestones, unblock dependencies, and ensure clear communication across teams.

✅ TPM Speak:  
“I ensure traceability from requirements through to deployment, aligning sprint planning with test cycles and customer delivery dates.”

## 🌀 2. Agile / Scrum / Kanban
- **Scrum**: Time-boxed sprints, roles (PO, SM, Dev), ceremonies (standup, planning, demo, retro)
- **Kanban**: Continuous delivery with WIP limits and visual task tracking
- **Waterfall**: Sequential phases, suitable for regulated or fixed-scope work

✅ TPM Speak:  
“I’ve led teams using both Scrum and Kanban. I adapt the model based on the team maturity and product volatility.”

## 🐍 3. Python for TPMs
- **Use Cases**: log parsing, automating reports, file processing, API integration
- **Key Concepts**: variables, functions, loops, exceptions, reading files

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('report.csv')
print(df[df['Status'] == 'Failed'])
```

✅ TPM Speak:  
“I’ve used Python for light automation, parsing build logs, and driving faster decision-making during rollout reviews.”

## ☁️ 4. Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

| Capability        | AWS            | Azure             | GCP                 |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Compute           | EC2, Lambda    | VMs, Azure Functions | Compute Engine, Cloud Functions |
| Storage           | S3             | Blob Storage       | Cloud Storage        |
| IAM               | IAM            | Azure AD, RBAC     | IAM                  |
| Containers        | EKS            | AKS                | GKE                  |

✅ TPM Speak:  
“I’m cloud-agnostic. I’ve worked with Azure-hosted systems but can bridge teams using AWS or GCP. It’s more about service mapping and SLAs.”

## ☸️ 5. Kubernetes + Terraform + CI/CD
- **Kubernetes**: Manages containers at scale; core terms include Pods, Services, Nodes
- **Terraform**: Defines and deploys infrastructure using code (IaC)
- **CI/CD**: Automates testing and deployment; common tools are Jenkins, GitHub Actions

✅ TPM Speak:  
“I ensure teams build resilient CI/CD pipelines, using Terraform for predictable infrastructure and K8s for scalable apps.”

## 🧠 6. Program Management Best Practices
- **Risk Management**: Identify early, assign owners, build mitigation plans
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Execs need summaries/KPIs, engineers need priorities and blockers
- **Tools**: Jira, Confluence, Power BI, Excel, RAG reports

✅ TPM Speak:  
“I run weekly stakeholder syncs and drive accountability through action-item dashboards and burn-up reports.”

## 📊 7. Splunk (Bonus)
- **Purpose**: Real-time log aggregation, monitoring, and analytics
- **Use Cases**: Security events, system telemetry, debugging
- **Benefit**: Helps reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)

✅ TPM Speak:  
“While I haven’t used Splunk hands-on, I understand its role in log centralization, observability, and post-mortem analysis.”
