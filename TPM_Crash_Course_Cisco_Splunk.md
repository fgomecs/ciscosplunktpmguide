## 🔁 1. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- **Phases**: Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
- **Models**: Waterfall (sequential), Agile (iterative), DevOps (continuous)
- **TPM Role**: Coordinate milestones, unblock dependencies, own communication across phases.

## 🌀 2. Agile / Scrum / Kanban
- **Scrum**: Time-boxed sprints, daily standups, sprint planning/review/retrospective.
- **Kanban**: Continuous delivery, WIP limits, visual task flow.
- **Waterfall**: Best for stable, well-defined projects.

✅ TPM Speak:
> “I’ve led teams using Scrum and Kanban. I adapt based on product lifecycle and team maturity.”

## 🐍 3. Python for TPMs
- **Core syntax**: loops, functions, conditionals, exceptions
- **Common use cases**: log parsing, automation, data cleanup, API calls

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('report.csv')
print(df[df['Status'] == 'Failed'])
```

✅ TPM Speak:
> “I’ve used Python for automation, log parsing, and driving faster decisions using simple scripts.”

## ☁️ 4. Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
| Service     | AWS            | Azure           | GCP              |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Compute     | EC2, Lambda    | VMs, Functions   | Compute Engine   |
| Storage     | S3             | Blob             | Cloud Storage    |
| Containers  | EKS            | AKS              | GKE              |
| IAM         | IAM            | Azure AD, RBAC   | IAM              |

✅ TPM Speak:
> “I’m cloud-agnostic. I work with engineers to align requirements with service cost, performance, and security.”

## ☸️ 5. Kubernetes + Terraform + CI/CD
- **Kubernetes**: Automates deployment, scaling, and ops of containers
  - Pods = containers
  - Services = expose pods
- **Terraform**: Declarative IaC (cloud resources as code)
- **CI/CD**: Code → Build → Test → Deploy (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

✅ TPM Speak:
> “I ensure teams build resilient CI/CD pipelines, using Terraform for predictable infrastructure and K8s for scalable apps.”

## 🧠 6. Program Management Best Practices
- **Risk management**: Identify, assign, mitigate, monitor
- **Communication**: Tailor for execs vs engineers (status, RAG reports, blockers)
- **Cadence**: Weekly syncs, sprint reviews, quarterly planning
- **Tools**: Jira, Confluence, Excel, Power BI

✅ TPM Speak:
> “I run weekly stakeholder syncs, track actions with burnup reports, and proactively surface risks.”

## 📊 7. Splunk (Bonus)
- Centralized log management and analytics
- Used for: Security, observability, incident response
- Helps reduce MTTR, centralize event monitoring

✅ TPM Speak:
> “I understand Splunk’s role in real-time logging, performance monitoring, and post-incident diagnostics.”
